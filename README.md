# The Fate of D.B. Cooper: Micro Jam 052 (Winter) - Game Project

## This is a smol game I developed with an artist and a composer for the Micro Jam 052 with the theme of Winter.

The game was inspired by the legendary story of D.B. Cooper, a man who hijacked a plane in 1971 and managed to escape with $200,000 in cash.
